This is worse for the flying enemies, which can hover over pits, making fighting them even more of a hassle.

I WANT to like it, but it constantly decides to be frustrating in exactly he wrong ways. I've seen reviews that say this game required skill, I found the opposite. Skill took the back seat, and instead luck was the ruler of the day. For those who don't want to read the long version, I'd say this: if I'd paid more than the $5 I got it for, I'd feel ripped off. As it is, this game is very flawed execution of a good idea, which still manages to have short stretches of good fun. The fairly unforgiving nature of the game, what with no real defense options makes it somewhat of a strange sell for casual gamers (which seems to be the target audience), but hey, seems to be working for a lot of people according to other reviews. Can't say that I agree with how many people recommend the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it basically seems that Reaper was meant to be a bit like an RPG lite, where you could play a few quests and have a bit of fun, not having to get too bogged down in a really in-depth game. Well, right there I'll say that if you like the kind of complex stories that RPG's are generally known for, this story is gonna feel a bit like \"Plot, what Plot?\" There basically isn't a plot. I will refer to the character as \"The Pale Swordsman\", since he has no consistent name or title so far in the game. This may change later, but honestly, the point is relatively moot as the gameplay is so flawed, but I thought I'd mention the story early, since there's little to say. However, enough fluff, time for some crunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "First problem, the auto attack. It does not trigger nearly as much as it should. It feels like the Pale Swordsman is using a prison shank, because you have to get so close you could just about whisper in their ear. Which is strange, seeing as you're effectly using a buster sword, and I'm clearly within range, as I can trigger the uppercut or the slam, and it'll hit, but because of how the rage skulls work, this is not the way you should be playing, as these skills are significantly weaker with no skulls, so you have to rely on the auto hitting, which is less than reliable. This is probably to do with the game being a port from mobiles, but honestly, if you're gonna release a PC version, you should at least make use of the fact they have buttons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second problem, the controls generally. In short, the controls feel strange and imprecise. To elaborate, the game feels like the character is trapped in a world where the air has the consistency of treacle. Everything is very slowed down. More annoying still, I can't seem to stop bouncing off stuff... which wouldn't really be a problem, except that about 70% of things you're able to bounce off do damage. And it is not often that it's apparent this will happen. \n",
      "The thorns on those vines are EXTREMELY subtle. Tangentially, things in the background, like braziers and cauldrons of hot coal should not hurt you in the way they do, especially when they don't hurt ANYTHING besides you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though back to the controls point, it's often difficult to even tell when you're going to bounce. Why do I bounce off the normal ground when I'm using the whirling blade jump attack? Even sillier, why do I *sometimes* bounce off the Ground, and even the AIR? If it happened reliably one way or the other, it would be fine, but you can't rely on it. This will be a point later.\n",
      "Also, the Charge attack triggers WAY too easily. Which again, wouldn't necessarily be so bad, since it's the only way to get anywhere in a hurry... but with pits that do 50 damage (in a game where your base health is 100), you end up triggering the charge, when you don't want to. Which at best wastes a Rage Skull, and at worst makes you go down a pit and lose roughly half your HP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third and Last major gameplay problem: the Enemies. Basically all of them. You get ridiculous situations where you try (or as previously stated, don't try) to use your charge attack and charge into the back of a charging boar... only for you to be damaged by the arse of a retreating boar... Are they wombats? Do they have an armour-plated rear? But then you have the nigh-bullet hell amount of projectiles that are sent around the battlefield... and wouldn't you know it, you have no dodge roll, dash or any kind of reliable defense aside from the jump, which feels you're on the moon... and with the bouncing problem mentioned earlier...\n",
      "\n",
      "This got to be ridiculous when I was faced by a helicopter, which shoots seeker missiles... and I had to have an aerial duel with it over a strip of wooden palisade... The unreliability of the Air bouncing I said about? Yeah, anytime I didn't bounce of the air or the helicopter, I ended up falling onto the palisade and taking damage from the palisade, unless I used the charge in midair to save myself. Which of course wasted a Rage Skull, because I can't choose to only use the charge as an evasive dash. Instead, I basically have to use the weak version of the Buzzsaw jump attack to slowly whittle away health. Except when I glitch and cling to the helicopter like Spiderman... then I unleash auto-attack blades of fury, before dying because I can't tell I'm being hit (as it's just shotgunning me with it's smaller weapons).\n",
      "\n",
      "So to sum up, nice idea, very flawed execution, tests for storyline came back negative, controls feel strange, when I die I feel cheated.

At first i though this was going to be a button masher but the joy of button mashing was taken away from me as you simply walk into enemies to kill them.Sure you can jump around like a monkey on crack to get out of the way of the many spamming attacks of the enemy.

All i saw was the pale swordsman just sounding like he was shouting at everyone, since all his lines are in caps. An no matter what you say, you just sound like an uncaring douche.

      "- The Character \"progression\": It's pretty non existant. While it isn't that important in a game like this, it might as well have been left out. Every level you can choose one of three upgrades to skills (mostly just more damage, or a higher stunchance) or then just more hitpoints, strenght (damage) or speed. Doesn't even sound that bad, but as far as i can tell it really doesn't matter that much what you take. Choosing gear is even worse. You literally get swamped with gold, and as long as you dont buy every item thats worse than your current stuff, you can afford anything you want. \n",

      "- The combat: it's the same damn creeps over and over. And over and over and over and over again. They get a little stronger, have more hitpoints, but since the character progression is so linear and without real choices or variation, the difficulty stays the same the entire time. Sometimes they shoot orange balls, sometimes purple. Sometimes they wear pikes sometimes clubs, but that's pretty much it. While one, again, can not expect huge varierty from this sort of game, its still a little disappointing that there are so few strategies (and all real straight forward) on how to handle monsters.

It's surely not a hidden gem, it's a decently made basic game without any bugs (as far as i can tell), but it totally lacks variation or any sort of noticable progress.

As such the game has only 4 levels: 2 \"real\" dungeons, 1 challenge tower and 1 short final level. There's an overworld and lots of backtracking to pad the game out a bit but you can still easily 100% it in just 4 hours. NDSi also had a tiny 256x192 (4:3 aspect ratio) screen, so there's no widescreen support and the resolution is only 192p resulting in a very pixelated picture and a zoomed in look. The only improvements in the PC version are HD UI and character portraits (in dialog scenes), which frankly look rather jarring against the pixelated game assets.\n",

      "So, is this even worth playing? It depends, this was the first modern Shantae game and it set the framework for all later releases, both art style and character development wise. Risky's Revenge mainly acts as a prologue for [url=store.steampowered.com/app/345820]Pirate's Curse[/url] (which is an amazing game), and the latter's story might not make much sense without having played this first. Oh, and there's a pretty cool unlockable mode where Shantae is dressed in a very revealing Princess Leia like outfit (yes, it's the same outfit as that one scene in Pirate's Curse but for the whole game).\n",

I'm having a lot of fun mining, crafting, and exploring. Some of the graphics are really good, but others don't reach the quality of 7 Days 2 Die. If you don't mind grinding away at resource gathering to advance your tool making abilities, and to make items, and structures, you may really enjoy this game.

      "\n",
      " This game is pretty legit.  I'll be brief and quickly summarize my first impressions from playing this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Entralling Story - Having finished my first playthrough I can safely say that Skyborn offers an entertaining tale with various twists and turns that'll keep the player on their toes.  I found the closure at the end to be very satisfying as well (not really a spoiler, I'm primarily trying to convey that the end wasn't half assed).\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoidable combat - Unlike most RPGs where you run around and trigger random events that can't be seen, Skyborn has a system where players are able to physically see monsters on the screen.  This allows a player to circumvent an unwanted encounter while providing the option of easy EXP as well if they find themselves underleveled. Edit: I'll say this now - avoidable mobs are all OPTIONAL.  Under no circumstances was I ever pressed to level/grind on a normal clear.  I'm currently working on a hard clear to see if this is the same case.  Don't let this discourage you though, boss fights are still pretty difficult depending on your composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battle Arena - Later on in the game there's an arena that offers a substantial challenge if you find the fights to be too easy.  It poses a significant challenge compared to typical encounters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crafting system - I haven't tried it too thoroughly yet, however there is a system in place for harvesting minerals etc and for creating weapons and armor.  It hasn't been too impactful in my playthrough since I've been finding gear frequently enough as is, but it's a nice side touch to have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistency/Persistent Story - The game feels very consistent throughout, and when I say that I mean so with regards to the story alawys being present.  Unlike other RPGs where you get a 30 second snippet of dialog followed by 2 hours of grinding mobs through a tower in order to reach an objective, Skyborn does a decent job of adding in short excerpts of character interaction to alleviate the grind.  While progressing through dungeons characters will talk and continue to give the player story while dungeon crawling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Music - The music in this game is by far satisfying and enjoyable to listen to.  This of course is my own personal preference, however if something like this appeals to you then by all means consider this when making your decision as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Lack of Backtracking - There are a couple of areas where I realized some chests were left unlooted due to not understanding certain trigger mechanics until later in the game.  From what I can tell, I'm unable to revisit these places for the time being since map movement is very story driven.  This is important because certain items come from said chests... and one of the initial lines implies that you want to collect all of a particular set for extraordinary rewards. Edit: At some point in the game it does allow for freedom of movement/control of your ship/destination - just don't expect it too soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Options/Settings - I found this panel to be very lacking.  Not only do audio settings not save (I found myself having to lower game volume manually through the audio manager my OS provides) but there's very little customization available.  You can change the color of the major panels, however keybindings cannot be changed.  On top of that, the tutorial isn't very extensive, so figuring out what binds to what is a bit difficult at first.  They do bring up the least obvious binding (X has uses apparently), but they fail to mention that other buttons such as spacebar and enter can function as an \"a\" button if you were to play a hand held.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stat Values - This is the min/maxer speaking at the moment.  With regards to stats in this game, their effects are very helterskelter as far as values go.  I'm not talking specific number crunching for damage per turn etc but rather lack of clarity.  It's not exactly clear what +1 agility will do as opposed to +1 strength which was a bit frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for now, I'm a very satisfied customer considering the price I paid for this.  I'd strongly recommend it to anyone that was a fan of the old FFs (1-2 etc) who have a strong desire for pretty driven plot.  Overall, I'd give this game an 7.5/10 with everything above in mind. As far as buying goes, I'd be a bit hesitant in recommending full price for this game.  With the current half off sale though, it's very much so a buy that gives you your bang for your buck!, true, 1393042902,, 1479925259, true, 1, 421, 0.955238044261932373, false], [[1469383331, 645, 110, 1893, 1993, 0, 76561198004313984], 9,, english, false, 21942623, Skyborn is a unique story driven R.P.G. developed by Dancing Dragon Games and published by Degica. The Skyborn are a winged humanoid race that has defeated in war and consequently subjugated humankind. You take on the role of Claret Spencer, the star mechanic of an independent repair shop, who suddenly finds herself pulled into an epic city wide conflict which takes her and her friends on a journey through a tale of magic, metal and mystery as she unravels the secrets of the Skyborn. This is a R.P.G. Maker title which up to this point I had never heard of although I have played many games in the past with this same look and style. For those that don't know, R.P.G. Maker is a program that allows users to create their very own role playing games. With that said, the gripping story in this title is really well conceived and unfolds over the course of the game in unvoiced dialogue and cutscenes many times alongside gorgeous anime inspired handrawn artwork that is truly a pleasure to the eyes. There's enough intrigue, action and humor in this wonderful game to keep you consistently playing from start to finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you travel through the beautiful and heavily steampunk themed world of the game, Claret and the allies that she manages to assemble along the way will be forced to do battle against the Skyborn themselves as well as a variety of other enemies and adversaries. The combat in this title, which is very fun and quite different from the typical R.P.G.'s that I tend to play, takes place in the form of the turn based J.R.P.G. battle systems similiar to many classic well known Japanese Role Playing Games like Final Fantasy and Grandia. As you win you constantly earn experience points and automatically level up your group. You also have the ability to upgrade the gear of your character and companions by purchasing, looting or crafting various weapon and armor sets. Besides the main story, Claret will meet many interesting and sometimes hilarious N.P.C.'s who will provide you with the chance to take on any number of optional sidequests. There is also an incentive to explore the world because there are many hidden items to find which can yield extra experience points and crafting materials as well as currency. \n",

      "The musical score and sound effects in this title are phenomenal and fit the gameplay perfectly. Whether you are engaged in battle, leisurely strolling about or having a conversation there are tracks to suit the occasion. The world is filled with gears grinding and smokestacks puffing as one would expect in a steampunk themed game and this title does not dissapoint. I find myself listening to the classically inspired soundtrack on a daily basis as I'm logged on to Steam and will continue to do so because it's that memorable. \n",

      "Discovering this game came as a huge surprise for me as I never thought that I would have enjoyed a title such as this as much as I have. Playing this game has definitely piqued my interest in the R.P.G. Maker genre. Like I stated before, this genre is completely new to me but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this title has to be one of the most well developed and polished of them all. I constantly find myself scouring Steam every week hoping that I might one day come across another gem like this one. If you're looking for a lighthearted roleplaying game with a fantastic story, just the right amount of humor and interesting combat then look no further...Skyborn would make an excellent addition to your library and is highly recommended! As a side note, the developers have recently begun asking the Steam community what they would like in another Skyborn game so I'm crossing my fingers and hope to die that a sequel could definitely be in the works., true, 1458471598,, 1458499716, true, 1, 58, 0.825113892555236816, false], [[1393077860, 422, 2, 387, 387, 0, 76561198013899592], 1,, english, false, 9218646, Recommended!

      "Great if you're a fan of JRPGS! A tough sell at 15$, but I have no trouble recommending it at it's sale price of 7.49, true, 1393078648,, 1393078648, true, 1, 54, 0.813736200332641602, false], [[1411885832, 103, 10, 1166, 1166, 0, 76561198046869008], 3,, english, false, 12271922, Don't let the RPGMaker tag fool you, this is actually a fantastic game, reminiscent of the best JRPGs of the classic 16- and 32-bit era. The ensemble cast is fun and memorable, with each party member complementing each others quite nicely with their unique abilities. Too often in such games you will find a slew of useless abilities, status effects and debuffs that don't work (or that are nowhere near as useful as just dealing damage, for instance), but in this game, you have to really utilize each party member wisely to win, at least if you play on Hard (highly recommended for the best experience, though you will need an optimized party for the last boss). To the dev's credits, I don't think I found a single ability that was useless, and that's pretty much unheard of in the genre. ^^\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no random battles; enemies appear on the screen, and they do not respawn. This is a godsend, because if there's one thing I don't miss from old jRPGs it's random battles every two steps that constantly interrupt your exploration. Each battle is fairly meaningful (again, on Hard) with plenty of strategy. Dungeon design could have been a bit more imaginative, it's mostly just standard \"flip this switch to open this path\"; but at least there's rewarding exploration and that's good enough. I would suggest to the devs to add more meaningful puzzles (à la Golden Sun or Wild ARMs) in a future game, that'd turn your game from good to spectacular. ^^ \n",
      "\n",
      "The story is nothing too original but it's well-written and engaging, never once did I groan in dismay at silly plot twists or anything like that, which happens far too often in these types of games, so congrats on a job well done. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh and what are RPGs without good soundtracks and art direction? Skyborn's is excellent in both cases, so don't worry about that. I really loved the sprites and characters portraits, the artists are clearly very talented.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do have some mild criticism, but it's nothing that detracted from my enjoyment: the dungeons could have been even better, as I mentioned before, and the crafting system is a bit tacked on, IMO, and not all that useful. And when shopping for equipment, there should be a better UI to compare with what you have equipped (and of course offer to auto-equip after buying). Luckily, the menus are quick and snappy so it's not much of an issue to navigate between menus, but that could certainly have been improved upon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some have complained that the game is too short, but I disagree. Doing all the optional content I could find and retrying the last boss a few times, I have about 19 hours; that's more than fair for a game without filler. Personally I prefer this over a 50 hour long game with tons of boring side-quests and meandering stories that drag on and on, so I have no problem with the game's length. YMMV. I suspect those who spent less than 10 hours probably played on Normal or Easy and breezed through without doing the side-stuff, which is weird to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by how good this game was. I hesitated a long time before buying it, expecting a decent but probably amateurish product, but it's actually very well made, very polished, and the combat is, without hyperbole, among the best I've seen in turn-based JRPGs., true, 1411888117,, 1411888117, true, 3, 40, 0.807945430278778076, false], [[1394322944, 997, 46, 724, 752, 0, 76561197990969478], 0,, english, false, 9392254, When the touchy subject of RPG Maker commercial games comes up, I am not one to judge or deny the legitimacy of RPG Maker games as a commercial product. I have seen some fantastic games made on the engine like To The Moon, and I have seen absolute garbage like the Laxius Force and Millenium Quest series being put up for sale. My interest for this title was raised when the discussion on RPG Maker commercial games mentioned Deadly Sin and its sequel as an example of good RPG Maker games, and one of the studio's earlier titles was this.\n",
      "\n",
      "This game is a short story set in a steampunk fantasy world where the plot involves Claret Spencer, a mechanic who is about to get entangled in a pivotal racist conspiracy involving the Skyborn, a race of magic users with Dragon-wings, Humans, the ancient and near-extinct Fey, and Half-Breeds, the result of a Skyborn and a Human mating. The story is really focused in scope, goes through predictable motions and doesn't do enough world-building to be compelling. However, what it does have as far as story goes is quite competently written, and the characters in the story are fairly consistent in their actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gameplay has a few unique twists to the bog-standard turn-based RPG and equipment system in that armor doesn't  directly come into play for damage-reduction, but instead, they increase various stats depending on type. In a way, the type of armor used determines the type of build for each character. The combat system is a standard Conditional Turn Based system but with a twist to keep things interesting, and encourages players to use more support skills, and it's the Threat system. Characters with the most threat will be targeted for single-target attacks, dealing damage and killing enemies will increase the threat of that character for the duration of the battle. This system allows for the utility of skills that can transfer threat from one character to another, or to gather an enormous amount of threat for one's self. This combination of systems allows for a lot of min maxing to be employed, which is pretty refreshing for an RPG Maker game. There is also an augment and forging system that allows players to further customise their gear, which is good. \n",
      "\n",
      "What is not so good, however, is the unintuitive way of how the stats are used and how they are never explained ingame. See, the Strength stat determines the damage dealt by regular weapon attacks regardless of type, Intelligence determines the effectiveness of special skills, and Agility merely determines the Speed, Critical and Evade chance. While this would make sense normally, there is also the idea that there are 3 different types of damage ; Physical, Magic and Tech and one would easily be forgiven for thinking that Strength, Intelligence and Agility would determine the effectiveness of Physical, Magical and Tech attacks respectively. This leaves for some results that just plain doesn't make sense, like Corwin's (The designated mage/healer.) magical blast weapon damage that is determined by his strength instead of Intelligence. The other issue with the combat and gameplay is that on Normal, it is either too easy, or you get wiped out real quickly, with no battles that provide an evenly-matched struggle, and the being wiped-out part only ever happens if you don't do the side-quests before the point of no return. Once you did all the side-quests before the endgame, then the endgame becomes ridiculously easy again,\n",
      "\n",
      "Another bugbear of the gameplay of this game is that very few of the objects in the game can be interacted with with any measure, which brings us back to the point of the game being very focused and limited in scope to the point of its own detriment. It would have been nice if there are more props that give you flavour text, added an effect to your party, or can be interacted with to produce a sound effect. (Piano jingle, anyone?) As an RPG afficionado, I can tell you that most RPGs offer an immense amount of non-plot-relevant interactivity, which goes a long way with the immersion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue is that there aren't enough variety in the enemy mobs to keep things interesting. All the enemy mobs have a role that is theoretically mirrored by one of the characters', and very few of the skills that enemies have are unique to the enemies, as a result, most enemies are very predictable, and thus very easy to deal with, even enemies with the ability to OHKO half your party. That said, the abilities that you do gain throughout the game are very useful and are a nice change from the generic damage ones that plagues most RPG Maker games. I also do like the design of the dungeons themselves which strayed a lot from the conventional square-like design that even commercial RPGs from the 90's suffer from, this results in a lot of the dungeons and natural cave systems looking very very organic, which is a great plus for this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strongest point of this game though, is the music. The soundtrack is very well-mastered with a lot of nice orchestral stings and swelling chords befitting of a fantasy RPG. It is no Falcom Sound Team JDK, but as far as indie RPG Maker projects go, the fact that the soundtrack isn't a set of crappy generic MIDIs alone is something I can appreciate a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the final verdict is, do I recommend this game? And the answer is unfortunately, nope. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this game, and as far as RPG Maker games go, this is one of the better ones. However, with how limited and focused the scope of the game is, there is not enough world-building and lore to keep the player invested in the story and its characters, and the paltry offering with regards to interactivity and side-quests certainly didn't help it. Ultimately, the biggest drawback of this game is that it is not ambitious enough for the premise it presents, and maybe if the combat system is given more depth, if there are more character and story arcs, and if there is a less-linear progression through the story, then it might be worth the $15 asking price. As it stands, I cannot really recommend this game, outside of at least a 50% off sale, unless you really like RPG Maker games., true, 1394328139,, 1394362445, false, 2, 155, 0.804987072944641113, false], [[1393034316, 1220, 18, 72, 72, 0, 76561197982285315], 5,, english, false, 9208195, Great classic style RPG with a very mature storyline and the characters are easy to relate to. Combat is quite fun and the augmentation system adds a little flavor to your gear so you can modify the characters as you see fit. The game itself allows you to explore for hidden items and upgrades and there are very few random battles which is the main reason I tend to avoid this style of RPG, so that is a definite plus! Monsters are visually wandering around and you can choose to fight or walk right by them most of the time when the story permits.

The story is there, it isn't an award winning story, it's a story that holds together the game and the characters well enough.  Sound design is alright, nothing to really complain about, but I ended up muting the music and just playing mine.  There is a crafting system that ends up being useless an hour into the game, and an augmenting system that you will always use.  Character classes are simple enough to understand, some classes have passives along with their active skills.\n",

      "There is absolutely no grind in this game, and the non essential/mob fights are triggered by walking into them.  For the first few hours I felt that I needed to kill every single mob which do not respawn from what I've noticed, eventually I stopped doing this and didn't feel behind in levels.  After a certain segment, you gain access to sidequest that lead you to areas where the monsters are capable of OHKO everyone except for your main tank, with proper strategy (not really that hard) no one should die.

      "You play as Claret Spencer a very skilled mechanic who finds herself caught between a war/rebellion against the different races of the world. The Skyborns ( a race of winged magical humaniods who believe they are above all other races and should rule) the half-breeds ( a race of half human half skyborn who are looked at as abominations) and the humans (who are nothing special in the eyes of the skyborns). I feel that the story had very deep and emotinal moments that made the characters very interesting, each character had there own background story and purpose and were developed very well within the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "GAMEPLAY:\n",
      "It is your basic RPG Maker kind of game, there are no random encounters and all enemeies are shown on the field and running into them will cause a battle to commence. You have a party of 5 characters, each with there own weapons and skills to use during battle.  You dont actually see the characters battle it out as only their portraits are shown and the effects of there skills when chosen.  After battle you are rewarded with XP, Gold and sometimes items.  When exploring you may come across treasure chest that may contain all sort of items, money or equipment.  The equipment system was interesting in this game as any character could wear any type of armor but some characters would be affected by this greatly for example: a character who was a small build would have a higher speed meaning they would attack first or even have more turns to attack, they could wear heavy armor for more protection but it would slow them down thus making them have less speed and less turns. So it made you plan out what equipment to put on each character depending on their stats. During battles your characters also had a threat meter so when your characters attacked the meter would fill up,  When it was a enemies turn to attack which ever character had a higher threat meter would be attacked first, this made certain battle crucial as you didn't want your characters with low HP to have a higher threat meter so it made you plan out your turns a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "FEATURES:\n",
      "You were also able to find materials throughout the game that could be used at a forge to make new weapons and armors.  I found this to be a cool feature for a RPG maker game to have, or at least for the for the first half of the game as eventually later in the game the shops sold better gear than I could craft.  Augumenting was also a great feature in this game.   You could use Gems or certain items to augument your gear meaning enhancing the equipment with special status buffs.  A gem could increase the attack power of a weapon if used to augument a weapon or give you more HP if placed on a armor so this also added more dept into customizing your characters.  The game had a few side quest but nothing to rememberable to mention. The game music was very nice and well placed for each scenario.  The artwork and sprites were very well done. Another cool feature was in the game was that each character had a class.  At certain points in the game their class would upgrade giving you 2 choices on which class you wanted your character to lean towards (giving you different abilites and stats) this was a nice feature to add in.\n",

I’m glad I did, because Skyborn is just as fun despite being older and less polished. I wasn’t too keen on the combat system at first, since it doesn’t have the top-down view that I’m used to in these RPGs, but I quickly got used to it and soon it wasn’t an issue at all. The battle system is actually quite complex, and at least on hard mode, using your buffs and debuffs becomes essential to winning. I like that you can’t just spam attacks to win, and it requires a strong understanding of your gear, augments, and skills to succeed.\n",

After researching this fight, it appears I'm not alone in this failure. It seems that completing arena IS VITAL to the success of the game. There's no mention of this throughout the game, though. No way for the player to know that they SHOULD complete this content in order to successfully beat the boss. Now, I played this on normal since it was my first go. I ultimatley had to turn the boss down to easy to beat the game because I didn't have the correct abilities needed to take down this boss.

I don't suggest this. You'll miss out on a lot of a fun events, like when you find a Mogwai-esque creature and have the choice to feed it and get it wet before giving it back to Phoebe Cates herself. There IS a point around the third episode where the battles started to feel repetitive, but that soon went away as I found myself smashing Transformers with a freakin' axe. Not everyone is going to like it, but there are enough options in battle to keep situations fresh if need be. Better healing options (I didn't find a single GREAT healing item in my run) and more PCs (or a Paper Mario-esque helper) would have spiced up the battles, but if you're a fan of this type of battle system then you'll enjoy it.\n",

Let the fact that I have played it for over 30 hours stand as a testament to that. Despite that love, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It is a wonderful throw back to the kinds of games I used to play in my childhood, and I desperately wish there were more games like it. But the developer for this title never actually completed this game. To this day, 7 years after its release, there are still intolerable bugs that can crash the game, or cut entire sidequests off. These various issues will never be fixed, as the developer simply stopped communicating with his backers years ago and never has any plans to implement what should be relatively easy fixes.\n",

The same type of puzzles as other games, and even repurposing some of the character art from Enigmatis (or vice versa?). Overall, just okay. Not a compelling story by any means. It \"fills the void\" while waiting for better HOGs to come along., true, 1610811613,, 1610811613, true, 0, 1, 0.523026347160339355, false]]

Blackgate is a 2.5D game, that plays like a side-scrolling game. You mostly move left and right, but also able to move to the foreground or background on some occasions. If you think this is a low-budget, unrelated, cash-grab game, it's not, story-wise it's pretty decent and has strong ties to the story of Arkham Origins. Many Arkham series characters also appear, with the same voice actors reprising their roles. I also like the fully voiced, comic book style cutscenes they use. Another feature I like is that you can change your Batsuit anytime, anywhere, with each suit having a different look and buffs.\n",

      "However, the gameplay is one big problem. It's too much of a puzzle platformer compared to other Arkham games. Due to the nature of the game, the maps are very maze-like and difficult to navigate, not to mention the map is also hard to read. Combat tries to be similar to the main game, but it's too clunky and doesn't have special moves. My main problem is there's no fast travel for the interior sections of the game. You wanna get one collectible inside a building? You gotta backtrack all the way back out. It seem like this game was purposely designed to artificially extend playtime. I would like to give this game a mixed review honestly, because even though I like the story and characters, the gameplay feels tedious most of the time., true, 1605253624,, 1605253624, true, 0, 4, 0.542899668216705322, false], [[1607642978, 826, 21, 448, 448, 0, 76561198068343793], 0,, english, false, 84019110, Just a huge chore to finish. Combat is non existent, stealth is a joke, exploration is annoying. There were maybe 2-3 parts where the game made use of the unique camera angle. Rest of the game is just a repetetive mess.

You then defend your territories (many of which hold resources, which, once again, is so simple, each node = 1 resource, so if you have 2 Metal Mines, you can build anything that requires 2 Metal Mines as many times as you want) and attack others. At which point you go into the combat mode. While it isn't turn based, you can pause the game to issue orders, similar to other games like Dragon Age: Origin. You then gather loot, which opens up more research options.\n",

      "Your NPC's all level up, Techs and Researches included. This is done by Soldiers via fighting battles, while for Tech + Researchers it is done by researching and producing/building. Every time a Soldier levels up, he gets a point to put into attributes, like Strength and Willpower (there are several) these stats in turn affect skills, like Aiming, Snap Shots, Manipulation, Charisma. Each attribute, when clicked, tells you want it improves and each skill tells you want it does. You also get Training Points to spend on various abilities, such as being able to Equip Heavy gear. As for non-combat NPC's, you can train them with Training Points too, these points go into things which help them speed up or improve various other things. Such as Research Speed or Production Speed.\n",

      "Let's get more detailed:\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterlight is \"more\" real time like XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Let's say there is an enemy attack on one of your territories you have e.g. 3 days to react. In the mean time you can keep on training or squad (which takes time actually), keep on with the production and so on if you need to do so. The opportunity of the attack doesn't vanish if you ignore it just to do one day more of research or you need additional time for producing a item (that is instantly ready in XCOM: Enemy Unknown).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also your scientists and technicians you take on a mission (which is quite a good idea because of some bonuses) are not available at your base and since getting to an attack spot needs a bit time it is important to manage well your base, squads and as well as the equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In combat it reminds me a lot to Jagged Alliance. You just can't spray and pray on an enemy if one of your squadees is in line of sight because the travel distance is actually calculated instead of simple numbers on hitting a target or not hitting like in the latest XCOM. The odds are showed to you so you know what are the chances of hitting own soldiers, in such case, or the enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combat system is very transparent and is comparable to Jagged Alliance Back in Action (pausable real time with each individual plan for any squad member). I don't want to bad mouth the newest XCOM. I still love it and it features much better graphics, innately better customization possibilities for your soldiers and it is more user friendly (interface, micro- & macromanagement) and feels just \"more modern\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This games got me hooked right from the beginning that many games aren't able to nowadays so you probably should get it., true, 1389114491,, 1412237154, true, 1, 210, 0.857988536357879639, false], [[1424937077, 221, 7, 1767, 2341, 0, 76561198052577107], 0,, english, false, 11329331, I've played both XCOM:EU/EW And UFO:AL for a significant ammount of time now, but I like Afterlight better overall.\n",
      "The depth of the game easily rivals if not outright defeats XCOM. The weapons can be modified with various attachments and ammunitions, and there are dozens of weapons, most of which are still useful by mid-lategame. Equipment loadouts range from weapons to inventory including spare magazines and more weapons or tools. \n",
      "It also does not burden you with pre-selected classes and equipment restrictions [Which cost me quite a few XCOM:EW playthrough attempts] since all your crew are capable of the same training and skills [Though alien teamates have different training from humans], which are also more indepth than XCOM. You can train military personell to run faster, damage specific species better, use heavy weapons/suits, or handle weapons faster to name a few categories.\n",
      "In XCOM's strategic play, you have to manage your money, alien resources, and research projects while scanning for alien ships. In Afterlight, you also have to attack and seize territory, and decide who to be friends with. Will you create lasting friendships or do eye their territories, looking for more land and resources?\n",
      "The game also has lasting consequences and effects. Team members aren't generic soldiers who happen to be a notch above the rest of millions. You've got a colony and a couple-dozen people to staff it, and those who die are gone, they aren't cloned or replaced, just dead. \n",
      "On that topic, terraforming [Because thats an obvious goal, right?] has visible overtime effects that ever-slowly escalate visibly on both tactical and strategic play. As terraforming carrys on over the days, you'll see the world turn green with blue slowly, and tactical maps will gain plants and grass graphics too. On top of that, more overgrown areas tend to have lower environmental hostility ratings for tactical battles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest upside it has, Afterlight's action is real-time with pausing and planning rather than XCOM's turn-based action. Running head-on into previously undetected enemies or missing a shot is no longer a death sentance for your troops, though avoiding the former is still advised. Realtime action and positioning all play a role, where a sniper lying prone on a cliffside can spot enemies and clear them out quickly, and cover is less important and less of an invasive mechanic [though when you get the chance, use it]. Stealth is also an option, with smaller suits, stealthy movement training and silencers all present and accounted for. In a rescue mission, I snuck into the camp, and extracted my target without having to kill more than 2 or 3 enemies patrolling that area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Afterlight is in many respects more realistic than XCOM, it still has downsides. The graphics aren't up-to-date and the dialogue switches tones and word-accents [You'll see what I mean if you watch videos with story dialogue.] The most invasive bugs such as the \"Green Grid Error\" as I call it where most of the map in tactical battles covered with green grid squares.

Difficulty spikes a couple of times as game throws larger numbers of increasingly powerful enemies at you, but they basically just rush you with no special tactics or real coordination between enemies. The game also generates TONS of tactical missions, there are about 100 regions on Mars with missions to capture every one, enemies counter attack generating defense missions, and the tac missions are fairly repetitive with you taking the same squad/equipment on a dozen or more missions between upgrades. The game does a poor job of keeping you updated as to where you are and what you are doing and the tactical camera went nuts on me a couple of times in the Martian underground.

In addition to the research, production, and tactical battles of the X-COM series, it adds an interesting story along with the need to capture territories and gather resources. Personally, I feel the real-time aspect of the battles makes strategy almost non-existant (at least for me), and the 3D graphics can make controlling the battlefield difficult at times.

      "This game I would consider real-time, however it has it's moments of turning into a turn based game. The difference here there is no set square you have to go on, and you are in control of when time stops. Being in control of time at first was annoying, as I didn't know why the game kept pausing on me. When I figured it out I found it brilliant : the game pauses after you have moved one of your players/gunners into position. Why is this neat? Well this ensures you have COMPLETE CONTROL over tactical positioning - literally ensuring that you know what enemies are in site or when someone is in position. The neat thing about this game is that you can tell your gunners exactly where to proceed. This is phenomenal when you want your gunners to stay and move near cover instead of cutting through the middle of the map (which easily ends up being spotted, getting shot at just for trying to get to cover). That was just the battle portion of the game, there is a strategy portion to it. They tried to nail every single detail they could and it seems they have. When you move your players and try to shoot at an enemy, it shows the chance % you have of hitting the target. \n",
      "\n",
      "You have a limited amount of gunners/civilians you can use and assign them to different positions (research, resources, military etc...). You are bound to a planet in which you may take certain territories which contain certain resources. From this tactical perspective you can build or add modules to your main colony building, allocate resources, choose what to research, modify and customize your assault teams, attempt to take a new territory, or send your military units off in your UFO spaceship to go deal with conflict (be it controlling new territory or defending a sector you have. One mission consists of defending your water supply line for example. Upon finishing missions, you are able to take back spoiled goods. Careful though, you cannot over cumber the UFO as it can become too heavy to fly. Keep your fuel levels in check as well or don't expect to get to the fight! \n",

It was sort of refreshing to see the glacier tile on one of the maps, but generally looking at orange got a bit boring. I know we are on a big red planet but don't be afraid to add something! More importantly, I hope that some sort of \"reaction\" button is added. Watch sort of works but doesn't trigger the characters to fire on site.

When I first purchased it, I treated it almost like a surrogate. But as I played it, and even more now after having played the new XCOM, I really feel that UFO: Afterlight has some points that distinguish it and make it a good game in its own right. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it's not a perfect game. The interface is annoying, and the pausable real time combat can be frustrating at times. I hate loosing an important character to an interface misclick, a pathing issue, not being able to navigate levels effectively, or not being able to react to enemy fire in time. \n",
      "\n",
      "But, when the chips are down, Afterlight was the most memorable of all the X-com-ish games that I have played. Why? Character. When you start the game, your roster of characters isn't randomly generated like in XCOM. Instead, you have the handful of members of a mars colony on the edge of survival. Characters have family relations, friendships, and history. Loosing a character on the battlefield means so much more when you know that that characters brother was right beside her, or that her mother is waiting back at base. The stories that unfold as you train your characters and send them on missions has much more impact when you see them as real poeple. \n",
      "\n",
      "The focus on characters extends to base management as well. Base management is an important part of the game, and much more developed than in Xcom: EU/EW. But in order to construct buildings, explore new territories, or do research, you need characters. Need to send a character with engineering skill to repair a pipeline? Do you send your best engineer, or do you hold him in reserve because he has combat skills? Do you reserve your quickest rover pilots for ferrying combat missions or explorations? That sort of thing. And while there are ways of getting new characters as the game progresses, this system means that losing a combat medic in the field may have drastic side effects for your research efforts at home. \n",
      "\n",
      "Technological development also feels more substantial in comparisons. Weapons have attachments, and there are many varieties of space suit that you can equip your people with. Space suits effect movement and stances, meaning that people in large, heavily armored suits may not be able to run or go prone, and people in light suits will be faster and stealthier. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, combat is the area that I think the game is the weakest (besides the voice acting. Its not the worst in the world, but it can be annoying at times). It is real time pausable, which sort of works, but because characters have very little in the way of AI, it means that inattention can be very fatal. There is a good enough variety of enemy types, equipment options, skills and maps to keep me interested throughout most of the game, but by the end I was starting to feel that it was a bit repetitive. Worse, sometimes failure feels cheap and frustrating, especially when you grow attached to characters. \n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something like XCOM: EU/EW but with a little more depth and character. As I said earlier, its not a great game, but it was memorable and fun. And at less than 10 dollars for a full games worth of playing time, its worth a try.\n",

I had plenty of fun blasting away aliens and robots with firing lines of several hard-edged badasses who survived decades of struggle and strife from the alien invasion on Earth, all to come and make Mars their new home. I had fun in the downtime, peeling back the evolving storyline, and going through the long and rewarding process of colonizing and terraforming Mars. It's a treat to actually watch the red planet turn green and blue as time passes, as seas and rivers and forests began reappearing in a land that hasn't seen life for millenia. It felt meaningful. Powerful. Like I was making a difference. This isn't so much repelling an alien invasion as it is fighting back opposing colonization forces in a bid to claim the planet.\n",

I have no trouble admitting that. Still, with patience, after I got used to it, I didn't regret my decision to buy the game. Quite the opposite. I do want everyone who buys UFO: Afterlight to know what they're getting into, of course. I just also want to stress that it's still a nice, nostalgic, intriguing buy.\n",

      "Myst: it's simple. It's the foundation of what a modern point-and-click adventure game would be. It was a technical marvel at the time and basically used to sell people the CD-ROM drive. It's also a puzzle game that you probably got because of an attractive-looking bundle that placed it at an astoundingly low $2.39 in its component of the 25th Anniversary Collection package. If you're going to get into this series, get that and do not buy the stand-alone version. No, I don't care how much your $7.19 is burning a hole in your pocket. It's a bad deal.

      "- Unified strategic-tactical zoom. I like using the mouse wheel to get a bigger picture.\n",
      "- Capturing enemy troops and making them slaves, and getting them to work/produce resources.\n",
      "- Storyboard and voice acting of Caeser\n",
      "- History lessons, fun facts in the tool tip pop ups.\n",
      "- Supply system and logistics. Its interesting to have to factor in the constant need for food. If only this was done better.\n",
      "- Supply: Getting resources around the map, rather than a phantom stockpile like in AOE2.\n",
      "- Supply lines, and interrupting them.\n",
      "- Morale of troops and enemies, routing. Idea done very well in Rome2: Total War, but half done here.\n",
      "- Taking hostages and sending them to other towns to guarantee public order.\n",
      "- Building camps at strategic points is good idea, but these are poorly done.\n",
      "- Seiging concepts are good - starve them out, drop their morale to zero and they surrender, or reduce the fortifications and overwhelm. I understandthe concepts but these are not clearly presented.\n",

      "Cons/Negatives/Feedback to Devs:\n",
      "\n",
      "-No multiplayer!\n",
      "- Confusion with the colour scheme. Zoomed in the Romans have green unit icons, but zoomed out, they are red figurines, and vice versa for the enemy/other factions. The faction colours are too similar.\n",
      "- There needs to be unique sounds to indicate an action happened. Unless you are closely watching everything in real time, the various drum beats mean nothing and blend in with the sound track.\n",
      "- There is no clear delineation between who is friend or foe until they start attacking you. There should be some colour system to indicate what your current diplomatic status is.\n",
      "- There is no clear indication of garrison or garrison strength. There is stacking under figurines on strategic map but these are not clear. Something better is needed, such as a flag.\n",
      "- \"Camp\" look fortified when built but are too easy to capture. There needs to be some visual cue that the camp is unguarded.\n",
      "- Supply lines are not clearly articulated. I want to hover mouse over line and see what the flow is, and what the rate of change is. I want to know the network, of where supplies are going, and how long to get there.\n",
      "- Diplomacy to way too simplistic. How is it can chose what treaty to have... can't the other side have a say?\n",
      "-How do I know the stats of an enemy asset? Wouldnt this be a mystery?\n",
      "- Faction flags are poorly done. These should clearly different from each other. Suggest and Icon.\n",
      "The use of figurines in general is poorly done. Its like trying recreate a board game, The figurines lack detail, need more colour differentiation and better indication of what their strength is.\n",
      "- Zoomed in Icons are too similar/ not easy enough to distinguish between unit types. More details needed on icons.\n",
      "- Resource problems... all the time... starving troops... swarming enemy... undefended settlements... no guidance from the tutorial, or manual. Its poorly presented.\n",
      "- No visual cues on stockpiles of resources at a settlement.\n",
      "- The icons indicating no food, poor morale, not in supply line, whatever the lightening symbol is etcare not clearly explained. Need a sound cue on whats going on. If voice acting is used some variety in expressions would be needed to avoid repitition (We're hungry!\" We haven't been paid!\" I cant get my goods to market!\" etc)\n",
      "- Needs clearer indication of when towns are requisitioned (rented!), who they are native to and that they are now under Roman control... otherwise it all looks Roman.\n",
      "- Requisitioning resources from allies means all workers in it disapear. Why can't I rent the resource and hire the workers too?\n",
      "The panels are too big and say too little.\n",
      "The figurines are too big and lack detail. Cities look the same zoomed out, but quite different zoomed in. Why do Gallic villages look like the Greek Acropolis??\n",
      "Combat system leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe I've been spoilt with RTW2... but seeing figures throwing javeline the wrong way in a seige is silly. No use of shield against missles.\n",
      "- Seeing slingers shoot through mountains to troops on a road on other side.\n",
      "- Castles look medieval... Gauls did not build such massive fortresses.\n",
      "- The range of units indication reticle is outrageously huge. A low key indication is needed.\n",
      "- Selecting units is too tricky. Suggest following conventions in other RTS.\n",
      "- Not enough detail in zoomed in unit icons. An inidcator bar on the left for something and on the right for something else would really help. This infor is on the unit detail panel but could better presented.\n",
      "- NSome features that could really improve gameplay: a technology system, unique resources,trade between factions, alliances where allies help, senate politics, disease/plague, civilians.\n",

      "If you get this, your patience will be tried, the learning curve steep, and the lack of expected niceties/features very fustrating. So much potential but it fell short by too far.This ambitious game has features that remind me of a number of games:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Morale like Total War, \n",
      "- Food like Caeser 3, \n",
      "- Zoom out like Supreme Commander, \n",

      "- Resource and supply like Knights and Merchants (and Settlers), \n",
      "- Building forts in strategic locations like AOE2,\n",
      "- Capturing forts/cities by attrition like 7 Kingdoms \n",
      "- Seasons and day/night like Empire Earth, \n",
      "- City capture like Rise of Nations, \n",
      "- Fog of war and figurines like Shogun Total War...\n",

      "...but all of them did each of these concepts much much better, including games from 2001 (13 years ago) Its an ambitious game but it needs the budget and technical wizardry of the big gaming developer publishers. It especially needs sounds and visual cues, and to improve icon differentiation.\n",

      "Overall, 6/10. I'm glad I only bought this on a 75% off special. In its unrefined state, its not ready for full price. However if some changes were made, along with my feedback, this could be an excellent game. Don't pay full price. If you get it, prepare to be disapointed, but maybe you'll see the good side too. Its no-where near as good as the premium product of Rome 2 Total War, and is quite a different style of game, but it has some different features to keep you coming back.\n",

These sorts of things are critical to know, even in the first tutorial mission or you will find your armies melting away with no undertstanding why.

Players new to strategy games can jump into the campaign mode and start playing immediately*, but there's also enough substance to keep veteran RTS gamers engaged. The graphics are passable and run smoothly on the highest settings, and the cutscenes are just that - static scenes drawn with a \"comic book\" style to them. It's a nice break from the bombardment of massively rendered 3D action scenes that end up cheesy and unrealistic because of bad anti-aliasing and direction. The comic book art is also very mature, and there is plenty of violence and blood, which is a nice touch as well.\n",

Even veteran RTS players will have to figure out some of the details by trial and error. The most glaring is the lack of explanation about hostages and captured city morale.

      "\n",
      "So what's bad? \n",
      "1.) Unit variety. Gauls/Britons/Germans all have the same old: Skirmisher(guys with swords), Slinger, Javelineer, Spearman and Cavalry. Gauls also get Archers, Romans only get Legionaries(strongest unit). Some subfactions get some statbonuses but most factions are essencially the same. I liked the variation in Heg. Gold, where Macedon, Persia, Athens, Illyria, Sparta, Nomads, Thracians and gerneric Greeks all had different unit-sets. They are however working on this and enabeling modding, so I'm optimistic. \n",
      "2.) The AI, while not particualry stupid*, has significant limits pertaining to it's inability to grasp the game, it does not train veterans, it builds buildings seemingly at random, it does not manage it's food supply properly etc. on the other hand this makes taking enemy cities less time consuming^^. \n",
      "3.) The forum is dead. If you got a problem, just ask here on steam, it's more likely to attract the devs, or other players for that matter.\n",
      "4.) In the Campaign you command Kaisars Gallic Legions. A common quest reward are extra Legionary Cohor... Brigades. As you play a special Campaign faction(and not the regular Sandbox Romans) you cannot train them yourself, in turn you cannot disband them, sounds ok sofar. However, to replenish these troops(and your Uber Archer and Slingerunits) you need Roman Population. Now where would you find that? In roman cities. Now guess how many roman cities there are in Belgiu... Belgia. One. An average city can sustain 2-4 Brigades. In essence, unless you only use low morale Gallic troops you are going to spend most of your time waiting for your Capital to recover it's pop. yeesh. Having \"culturechange\" as a rare Questreward as in Heg. Gold would have prevented this. \n",
      "5.) Workers/slaves cannot carry Food. Players of Heg. Gold will know why this is a bad thing, you essencially need to plonk down expensive camps everywhere so your troops don't die of starvation during a siege. That, or you upgrade your troops carry capactiy instead of Attack/Morale/Hitpoints/LOS/men per unit, and who wants that?\n",
      "6.) the Campaign ends with good old Cheese-R explaining his righteous struggle against the Senate and then whining a bit about his death. Something I find quite a remarkable thing to do for a corpse. Then again I find most non-rotting-related things quite remarkable if done by dead people. Also with the (horrible) intro movie showing him lead his legions over the Rubicon I would have at least expected a cliffhanger hinting to a sequel where he fights against the Senate, that or an optimistic but mysterious ending that incites young people to look up what happend to him on wikipedia just to discover his grim fate, that would have been neat, and cheaper.\n",

      "- this is an 8 year old game at this point (2020); although the overall graphics look fine, and the wide-screen adaptation isn't bad, the HO scenes aren't as sharp as I'd like, and some of the cinematics look less than stellar\n",
